# Book reading

I read books because I am a book reader. I read books because I love books. I think reading books is part of what I consider [[good_life]]. I tend to choose sci-fi books to read and I especially love space operas.

I also read books to learn, I think the best way to learn things is to first read the most important theory on the subject, then work in practice, and the final step is to read a more detailed oriented book. I wish there were more books that taught me how to think about problems in this particular domain with the key concepts. Concise at most two hundred pagers, preferably much less.

I maintain my book list in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)
