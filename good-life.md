# Good Life

My definition of a good life in a bullet-list:
* Think about interesting, hard problems, and get better at solving them
* Read books in a hammock
* Have a balanced life of outdoors, [[professional-me]], hobbies, exercise, other people that are bound together and not islands on their own
* Don't worry about money
* I enjoy working hard tactically to ensure that I can be idle most of the time. Being idle is a necessary part of my adaptability.
