# Good Life

My definition of a good life in a bullet-list:
* Think about interesting, hard problems
* Read books in a hammock
* Have a balanced life of outdoors, indoors, work, hobbies, other people that are bound together and not islands
* Don't worry about money
* Work hard tactically to ensure that I can be lazy most of the time
