Today in 100 days in SwiftUI
* Using bundles to load up resources
* Actionbaritems buttons
* onAppear to run code once in startup

SSH in SwiftUI apps:
* Adding packaging dependencies [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app)
* First testing [GitHub - jakeheis/Shout: SSH made easy in Swift](https://github.com/jakeheis/Shout). This didn't work too well out of the box.
